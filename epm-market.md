<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The EPM Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solution Polymerization</li><li>Suspension Polymerization</li></ul></p>
<p><p>EPM market types primarily include solution polymerization and suspension polymerization. Solution polymerization involves dissolving monomers in a solvent to create a homogeneous mixture, allowing for controlled polymerization and producing high-quality polymers with desirable properties. In contrast, suspension polymerization disperses monomers in a liquid medium, forming polymer beads while minimizing side reactions. Both methods cater to distinct applications, with solution polymerization offering enhanced clarity and suspension polymerization providing easier processing and handling, contributing to diverse end-use sectors such as adhesives, coatings, and plastics.</p></p>
