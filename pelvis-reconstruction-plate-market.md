<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pelvis Reconstruction Plate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Locking</li><li>Non-Locking</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pelvis reconstruction plate market is divided into two main types: locking and non-locking plates. Locking plates feature locking screws that securely attach to the plate, enhancing stability and allowing for better bone alignment during healing. These are preferred in complex fracture scenarios. Non-locking plates, on the other hand, rely on friction between screws and the plate for stabilization, making them simpler but often less effective in achieving optimal stabilization in challenging fractures. Both types cater to specific surgical needs.</p></p>
