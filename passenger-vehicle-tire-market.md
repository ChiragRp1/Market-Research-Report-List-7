<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Passenger Vehicle Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tire</li><li>Bias Tire</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The passenger vehicle tire market primarily features two types: radial tires and bias tires. Radial tires have ply cords arranged perpendicular to the direction of travel, offering better fuel efficiency, durability, and grip due to flexible sidewalls and a stable tread. Bias tires, with crisscrossed ply cords, provide robust construction and load-bearing capacity but are less efficient and less comfortable. Radial tires dominate the market due to superior performance, while bias tires are niche, often used in off-road or heavy-duty applications.</p></p>
