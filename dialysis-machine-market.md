<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dialysis Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Peritoneal Dialysis</li><li>Hemodialysis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dialysis machine market is categorized into two main types: peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis. Peritoneal dialysis involves using the lining of the abdomen to filter waste and excess fluid, allowing patients greater mobility and independence. Hemodialysis, on the other hand, utilizes a machine to pump blood through a filter, effectively removing toxins and excess fluids, typically requiring patients to visit treatment centers several times a week. Both methods are crucial for managing kidney failure, with distinct patient preferences and clinical applications.</p></p>
