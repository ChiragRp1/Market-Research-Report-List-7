<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The New Energy Vehicle Tyre Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tyre</li><li>Bias Tyre</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The New Energy Vehicle (NEV) tyre market primarily features two types: radial tyres and bias tyres. Radial tyres, characterized by their flexible sidewalls and stronger belts running perpendicular to the tread, provide better fuel efficiency, enhanced stability, and improved handling, making them suitable for NEVs. Bias tyres, on the other hand, have layers that crisscross, offering strong durability and load-bearing capacity; however, they typically have lower fuel efficiency and stability than radial tyres, limiting their popularity in this advanced market.</p></p>
