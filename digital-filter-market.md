<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Digital Filter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Infinite Impulse Response (IIR)</li><li>Finite Impulse Response (FIR)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The digital filter market is primarily divided into two types: Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) and Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters. IIR filters use feedback, allowing them to achieve sharp frequency responses with fewer coefficients, making them suitable for applications requiring real-time processing. In contrast, FIR filters have a finite number of outputs and are inherently stable, providing linear phase responses, which is ideal for signal integrity. The choice between IIR and FIR depends on specific application needs, such as performance, stability, and computational efficiency.</p></p>
